      Since it is an egg-rich dessert, pumpkin pie should be stored in the
      refrigerator. Allow the pie to cool for at least two hours, then cover it
      and transfer it to the fridge for up to four days. To freeze pumpkin pie,
      wrap it in several layers of plastic wrap and at least one layer of
      aluminum foil. Freeze for up to one month. Thaw in the fridge.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pastry Crust</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup cold butter or shortening</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pie pumpkin</li>
      <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        step 1<br />
        <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 2<br />
        <p>
          To make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut
          in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
          Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is moist enough
          to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 3<br />
        <p>
          Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a
          lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Place a 9-inch pie
          pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut a circle of
          dough 1 ½ inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough
          scraps and set pie pan aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 4<br />
        <p>
          Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer
          it right-side up over the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the
          bottom of the pan. Use two hands to flute the dough around the top
          edges.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 5<br />
        <p>
          To make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs,
          cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with an electric
          mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared crust.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 6<br />
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1
          inch from the edge comes out clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges
          with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling cooks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 7<br />
        <p>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving.</p>
